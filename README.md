This is my online CV using React. I am currently developing it on my spare time. In src > Design, you will find images of the design I made. The design is finished, however, I might make some minor changes as I develop it. I am working on the home page first, so there's where youll find the most progress.

The link to the page is: https://maypaytang.github.io/cv/
I'm having some issues with React on github pages. So the link might not work all the time.
